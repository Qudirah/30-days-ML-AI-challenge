# 🐍 30 Days in Python: From Zero to ML Hero

Welcome to the **30 Days in Python** challenge — a self-paced journey through foundational, intermediate, and advanced machine learning concepts using Python. This project documents my daily progress, insights, and solutions as I tackle real-world problems ranging from simple automation scripts to deploying AI-powered applications.

Each day focuses on solving a specific challenge, with hands-on code and explanations designed to deepen practical ML knowledge.
